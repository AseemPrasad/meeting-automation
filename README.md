**Meeting Automation AI Agent 
**
An AI meeting-automation agent that converts recorded meetings into structured tasks and decisions, and automatically syncs them into Asana/Linear using LLM-based task extraction and transcription pipelines.

1. User uploads a meeting recording
2. App extracts tasks + decisions
3. App sends a simple summary via email

The Problem it solves,
Teams take notes during meetings but rarely turn them into action items, follow-ups, or project updates, leading to lost decisions.

The agent solves the problem smoothly with its designed workflow..
all the participants of the meeting get their actionable summary and tasks right after the meeting ends via mail

**TECH STACK **

python + FastAPI

openAI whisper for transcription 

meta llama 3.1 for task extraction 


AI agents can be made in less time with the rise of n8n
But I have used Python and FastAPI because it offers customization,flexibility,performance and scalability.
It gives a better edge over other technologies as it can handle complex ai logic and custom integrations.
